# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this analysis is to create a report including cryptocurrencies that are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment.

Deliverable 1: Preprocess the dataset in order to perform PCA.

Deliverable 2: Reduce the dimensions of the DataFrame to three principal components and place these dimensions in a new DataFrame.

Deliverable 3: Create an elbow curve using hvPlot to find the best value for K from the pcs_df DataFrame created in Deliverable 2. Then, run the K-means algorithm to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrenciesâ€™ data.

Deliverable 4: Create scatter plots with Plotly Express and hvplot to visualize the distinct groups that correspond to the three principal components created in Deliverable 2, and create a table with all the currently tradable cryptocurrencies using the hvplot.table() function.
